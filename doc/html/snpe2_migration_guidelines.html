<div class="title">SNPE1 to SNPE2 Migration Guide </div>  </div>
</div><!--header-->
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>There are 2 primary changes that drove the major version update to SNPE2:</p><ul>
<li>C API<ul>
<li>SNPE2 introduces a C API.</li>
<li>This API will be the only way to interact with SNPE going forward.</li>
<li>The C API reduces/removes potential compatibility concerns that C++ can have (e.g. due to C++ templates).</li>
<li>To ease the transition, the C++ API will continue to be supported until early/mid 2023, at which point it will be retired.</li>
<li>For more information, reference the "C tutorial" section of "Code Examples" and C API sections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DLC Content Changes<ul>
<li>The contents of the DLC file are being updated.</li>
<li>These changes mean that the DLC is not compatible between SNPE1 and SNPE2.</li>
<li>All DLCs must be generated for SNPE2</li>
<li>HTP Offline Cache Records are backward compatible in SNPE2 - a cache generated with an older SNPE2 version will work in a later SNPE2 version.</li>
<li>Offline Caches in SNPE2 are compatible across SoCs:<ul>
<li>For the same DSP Arch, a cache prepared for one SoC can run on another SoC if the "prepared with VTCM" is less than or equal to the "target SoC VTCM". For example, a cache prepared for sm7450 with 2MB VTCM is compatible with sm8450 which has 8MB VTCM, but a cache prepared for sm8450 with 4MB VTCM will not be compatible with sm7450 which only has 2MB VTCM.</li>
<li>A cache generated for a newer DSP Arch cannot run on an SoC with a lower DSP Arch. A cache generated for sm8550 (v73) will not be compatible with sm8450 (v69), whereas a cache generated for sm8450 (v69) will be compatible with sm8550 (v73).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DLCs can now represent additional datatypes not supported by SNPE1 &ndash; cardinal datatypes (int8, int32, uint32), fp16<ul>
<li>These are in addition to the fp32 and quantized8 bit types that were supported in SNPE1</li>
<li>Any User Buffers will need to match the data types contained in the DLC.<ul>
<li>snpe-dlc-info can be used to identify the proper types</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additionally, the names of layers and input/output tensors may be assigned different names than in SNPE1.<ul>
<li>snpe-dlc-info can be used to identify and review what names the converters generate.</li>
<li>Inputs (generally referred as "Data" layer types) and "Const" layer types are now folded into the consuming Ops and not considered as standalone "layers". As a result, they will no longer be visible in the output generated by snpe-diagview and snpe-dlc-info tools.</li>
<li>If client code uses APIs like SNPEBuilder.setOutputTensors() to request specific output tensors, this code may have to be modified as a result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specific Significant Layer Changes<ul>
<li>The representation of the SSD Detector layer in models converted from Caffe has changed.<ul>
<li>In SNPE1 this layer emits a single output tensor containing 7 values per detection: 1 Batch Index, 1 Class ID, 1 Confidence Score, 4 box coordinates.</li>
<li>In SNPE2 the op now emits 4 separate outputs containing the same information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ArgMax now always outputs a uint32, so there may be some performance impact if the SNPE1 based model used an int8 output, due to the larger data size.<ul>
<li>Previously, SNPE1 would use int8 if the maximum value was less than or equal to 255.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SDK Behavior/Content Changes:</p><ul>
<li>Unsigned PD/Skels<ul>
<li>SNPE2 defaults to using Unsigned PD.</li>
<li>SNPE2 delivers unsigned skel files.</li>
<li>In order to use a Signed PD, the skels must be signed by the customer, and the signed PD must be explicitly requested at runtime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Runtime Changes:<ul>
<li>The DSP runtime for SOCs with V66 CDSP does not support running a float DLC. The DLC must be quantized to be used with the DSP runtime for these SOCs</li>
<li>For the GPU runtime, some of the initialization time is recorded differently, so init times will appear longer. This is simply a difference in how the initialization is measured and captured.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tool/Flag Changes:<ul>
<li>The snpe-dlc-quantize functionality has been refactored into two separate tools:<ul>
<li>A shell script is still provided that supports the previous command-line interface, and calls the new tools as appropriate.</li>
<li>snpe-dlc-quant: for generating the quantized DLCs from float DLC, with various quantization options.</li>
<li>snpe-dlc-graph-prepare: for performing offline graph preparation on quantized DLCs for HTP SOCs.<ul>
<li>This enables the flexibility to re-prepare the graph quickly from quantized DLC if needed, without needing to do both quantize and offline prepare which generally takes more time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flag Changes:<ul>
<li>The "bc" (bias correction) algorithm is deprecated, and has no effect.</li>
<li>The "enable_hta" option is deprecated and has no effect.<ul>
<li>Offline preparation for AIP is no longer supported, and all preparation is done at runtime.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>snpe-net-run:<ul>
<li>A new flag "--userbuffer_auto" has been added to automatically detect and create the right userbuffer type based on input and output tensor data type of the model. SDK Content Changes:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Caffe2 converter support is retired in SNPE2, and the converter is not delivered.</li>
<li>The snpe-dlc-reorder tool has been removed, as it is no longer relevant (it was only used for HTA offline prepare) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
